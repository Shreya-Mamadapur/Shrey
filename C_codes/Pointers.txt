Codes to know the size of char,int and double using pointers.

Program for char:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
char c = 'g';
char *cp = &c;
printf("cp is 0x%08x\n",cp);
printf("The character at cp is %c\n",*cp);
cp=cp+2;
printf("cp is 0x%08x\n",cp);
return 0;
} 


Program for int:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int c = 2;
double *cp = &c;
printf("cp is 0x%08x\n",cp);
printf("The value at cp is %d\n",*cp);
cp=cp+2;
printf("cp is 0x%08x\n",cp);
return 0;
}


Program for double:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
 double c = 2.12345;
 double *cp = &c;
 printf("cp is 0x%08x\n",cp);
 printf("The value at cp is %lf\n",*cp);
 cp=cp+2;
 printf("cp is 0x%08x\n",cp);
 return 0;
}
